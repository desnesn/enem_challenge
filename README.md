## ENEM Challenge
This is the repository of the code implemented for the final assignment of the IA024 course at UNICAMP.

With the use of GPT3 models, taking into consideration logprobs replies from OpenAI, we evaluated performance of davinci-002 and davinci-003 models on solving high stakes testing in portuguese for the Brazilian National High School Examination (ENEM).

This code applies the following prompts:
- zero-shot
- few-shots
- few-shots with Chain-of-Thought

The dataset used here is composed of 916 questions administered in years 2010 to 2017 available at ENEM Challenge <https://www.ime.usp.br/~ddm/project/enem/>.
